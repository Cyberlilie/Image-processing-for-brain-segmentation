# Image-processing-for-brain-segmentation - 2018
Implemented automatic segmentation in Python on 40 MRI images of newbornsâ€™ brains despite the low contrast. Applied k-means and the watershed algorithms. Managed to segment grey matter and grey nuclei.
Key technical tools : watershed algorithm, bigest component extraction, morphological operations (opening, closings)

Reports to be found in the files : CR_project.docx, and  Project_presentation.pptx; while code and results are to be found in the notebook Brain_seg_code.ipynb.
